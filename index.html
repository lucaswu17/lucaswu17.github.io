				<ul>
					<li>
						Our team built spatialtemporal heatmaps to visualize where overdoses tend to happen at a given time, such as <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/year.gif">heatmap by year</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/weekgif.gif">heatmap by weekday</a> for <a href="https://www.healthhackathon.ca/themes/theme7.html">Overdose Analytics by Fraser Health Hackthon</a>. <br />

						The objective of <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/202_final_report.pdf">my final project</a> of STATS 202: Data Mining and Analysis was to predict the relevance of search queries that users enter using Logistic Regression, NaiÌˆve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, GBM, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.<br/>

					<li>
						Participated in one of the Kaggle competitions - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">House Prices Competition</a>. Predicting house prises in Ames, Iowa given 79 explanatory variables.

						The goal of <a href="http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html">Undergraduate Case Study Competition</a> was to predict engagement, interaction, and revenue from players in a mobile social game. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/case_study_poster_final.pdf">infographic poster</a> presented by my team. <br/>
