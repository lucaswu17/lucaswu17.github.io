			<p>A collection of my projects:</p>
			
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Our team built spatialtemporal heatmaps to visualize where overdoses tend to happen at a given time, such as <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/year.gif">heatmap by year</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/weekgif.gif">heatmap by weekday</a> for <a href="https://www.healthhackathon.ca/themes/theme7.html">Overdose Analytics by Fraser Health Hackthon</a>. <br/>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Participated in one of the Kaggle competitions - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">House Prices Prediction</a>. Predicting house prises in Ames, Iowa given 79 explanatory variables. Check out my <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/housing_final.html">Report</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/housing_final.Rmd">R Code </a> here. 
					</li>					
					
					<li>
						 <a href="http://www.genalab.org/our-work.html">Big Data in Professional Sports</a> where we built a platform - <a href="https://gena-lab.github.io/Databall/">Databall</a> to provide game reports, statistics and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/lucas3244#!/">interactive shot charts</a> to coaches and players in NCAA basketball. <br/>
					</li>	

					<li>
						A project out of curiosity - which airport has the worst record for delays in the US? <a href=https://cdn.rawgit.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/52a6870c/airport-delay.html> Mapping the delayed airport</a>.
					</li>	
					
					<!-- The objective of <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/202_final_report.pdf">my final project</a> of STATS 202: Data Mining and Analysis was to predict the relevance of search queries that users enter using Logistic Regression, NaiÌˆve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, GBM, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.<br/>	</li> -->
			
					
					<li>
						Placed third at the <a href="http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html">Undergraduate Case Study Competition</a>, where the goal was to predict engagement, interaction, and revenue from players in a mobile game. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/case_study_poster_final.pdf">infographic poster</a> presented by my team. <br/>
