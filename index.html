				<ul>
					<li>
						Our <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/Sacramento_CASSIS_Poster.pdf">poster</a>, Personalized Foul Trouble in the NBA, presented at Cascadia Symposium on Statistics in Sports, 2018.

					</li>
					
					<li>
						Our team built spatialtemporal heatmaps to visualize where overdoses tend to happen at a given time using open data in Connecticut, such as <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/year.gif"> mapping the spread of drug overdose over years</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/weekgif.gif">contrast between weekday and weekend </a> during Fraser Health Hackathon. <br/>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						Participated in one of the Kaggle competitions - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">House Prices Prediction</a>. Predicting house prises in Ames, Iowa given 79 explanatory variables. Check out my <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/housing_final.html">Rmarkdown </a> and <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/housing_final.Rmd">R Code </a> here. 
					</li>					
					
					<li>
						 Worked on the research project Big Data in Professional Sports where we built a platform - <a href="https://gena-lab.github.io/Databall/">Databall</a> to provide game reports, statistics, visualization and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/lucas3244#!/">interactive shot charts</a> to coaches and players in NCAA basketball. <br/>
					</li>	

					<li>
						A project out of curiosity - which airport has the worst record for delays in the US? <a href=https://cdn.rawgit.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/52a6870c/airport-delay.html> Mapping the delayed airports</a>.
					</li>	
					
					<!-- The objective of <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/202_final_report.pdf">my final project</a> of STATS 202: Data Mining and Analysis was to predict the relevance of search queries that users enter using Logistic Regression, NaiÌˆve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, GBM, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks.<br/>	</li> -->
			
					
					<li>
						Placed third at the <a href="http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~dac5/CaseStudy2015/Welcome.html">Undergraduate Case Study Competition</a>, where the goal was to predict engagement, interaction, and revenue from players in a mobile game. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/lucaswu17/My-Project/blob/master/case_study_poster_final.pdf">infographic poster</a> presented by my team. <br/>
